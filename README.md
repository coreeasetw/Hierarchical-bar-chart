# Hierarchical bar chart

Static export of the Observable notebook “Hierarchical bar chart”. It renders the chart directly in the browser using the Observable runtime and includes the notebook cells in `c3c6660d2044f07e@369.js`.

## Local development

Serve the files in this folder with any static web server and open `index.html` in your browser, for example:

```sh
npx http-server
```

## GitHub Pages deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) publishes the contents of this repository to GitHub Pages. Once the workflow succeeds on your default branch, the site will be available at:

```
https://<your-account>.github.io/Hierarchical-bar-chart/
```

If your account or repository name differs, adjust the URL accordingly. You can also trigger the deployment manually via the **Run workflow** button in the Actions tab.
